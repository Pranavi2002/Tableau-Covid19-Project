## Tableau Dashboard Overview

This project contains 25 charts and KPIs that provide insights into COVID-19 patient criticality based on age, preconditions, and other factors. Below is a summary of each visualization and its purpose:

| Chart # | Chart Type / Name                         | Purpose                                                          |

## Tableau Project Structure

### Dashboards

- **Dashboard 1: KPIs**  
  Displays key performance indicators summarizing the patient data:  
  - Total Patients  
  - % Critical Cases  
  - Average Age of Critical Patients  
  - Most Common Condition in Critical Cases

- **Dashboard 2: Trends & Condition Selector**  
  Focuses on trends and user-driven exploration:  
  - Trend line chart showing cases over time  
  - Parameter-driven Condition Selector allowing dynamic comparison of critical vs non-critical cases by condition

### Story Points
